### Abstract
> In promoting cleaner cooking, the need for a systematic approach to group segmentation and target-group identification has been well recognized. Yet, no such approach has thus far been proposed. Here, we propose such a framework based on a Euclidean distance of householdsâ€™ fuel-choice behavior. Applying this framework to the post Gorkha-earthquake data on 762,106 households from Nepal, we find that ethnicity, as a criterion of segmentation, explains the highest intergroup diversity (39.12%) in fuel-choice pattern, followed by income (26.30%), education (12.62%), and location (4.05%). Among the ethnic groups, Chepang-Thamis have the lowest intragroup diversity (Shannon index = 0.101) and the Newars the highest (0.667). These diversity values can be useful in identifying target subgroups and then designing more targeted policy instruments, consistent with the behaviour of the subgroups. The notion of intergroup and intragroup diversity may also be useful in designing many other socio-economic policies.

### Dataset
Following the 7.8 Mw Gorkha Earthquake in Nepal on April 25, 2015, the Kathmandu Living Labs in collaboration with the National Planning Commission (the Government of Nepal), carried out the largest household survey ever done in Nepal using mobile technology. Although the primary objective of this survey was to assess damages inflicted by the quake and identify beneficiaries eligible for government's housing reconstruction grants, the data contain many other valuable socio-economic information, including the types of fuel used by households for cooking and lighting. The survey was carried out between January and March of 2016, about 10 months after the quake that killed over 9,000 people. The survey includes the information on 762,106 households (about 3.6 million individuals) from the 11 most earthquake-affected districts of Nepal excluding the Kathmandu valley. 

The data for all 11 districts were downloaded from the **2015 Nepal Earthquake: Open Data Portal** (<http://eq2015.npc.gov.np/>).
