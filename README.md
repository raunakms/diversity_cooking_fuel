### Abstract
> Segmenting population into subgroups with higher intergroup, but lower intragroup, heterogeneity can be useful in enhancing the effectiveness of many socio-economic policy interventions; yet it has received little attention in promoting clean cooking. Here, we use PERMANOVA, a distance-based multivariate analysis, to identify the factor that captures the highest intergroup heterogeneity in the choice of cooking fuels. Applying this approach to the post-earthquake data on 747,137 households from Nepal, we find that ethnicity explains 39.12% of variation in fuel choice, followed by income (26.30%), education (12.62%), and location (4.05%). This finding indicates that ethnicity, rather than income or other factors, as a basis of policy interventions may be more effective in promoting clean cooking. We also find that, among the ethnic groups in Nepal, the most marginalized Chepang/Thami community exhibits the lowest intragroup diversity (Shannon index = 0.101) while Newars the highest (0.667). This information on intra-ethnic diversity in fuel choice can have important policy implications for reducing ethnic gap in clean cooking.

### Dataset
Following the 7.8 Mw Gorkha Earthquake in Nepal on April 25, 2015, the Kathmandu Living Labs in collaboration with the National Planning Commission (the Government of Nepal), carried out the largest household survey ever done in Nepal using mobile technology. Although the primary objective of this survey was to assess damages inflicted by the quake and identify beneficiaries eligible for governmentâ€™s housing reconstruction grants, the data contain many other kinds of valuable socio-economic information, including the types of fuel used by households for cooking and lighting from 11 of the most earthquake-affected districts of Nepal, excluding the Kathmandu valley. 

The data for all 11 districts were downloaded from the **2015 Nepal Earthquake: Open Data Portal** (<http://eq2015.npc.gov.np/>).
